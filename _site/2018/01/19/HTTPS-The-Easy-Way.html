<p>If you’re making an application for the web then you have probably thought about securing your app with HTTPS. If you’re trying to program the encryption into your application, then you’re making it harder then it has to be.</p>

<p><em>This article is to convince you why offloading is the best practice. For a practical guide on how to setup HTTPS with your web application, see my other post: <a href="/2018/01/20/Make-your-web-app-use-HTTPS-in-30-minutes">Make your web app use HTTPS in 30 minutes with Let’s Encrypt and NGINX</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="offloading-encryption-to-a-proxy">Offloading encryption to a proxy</h2>
<p>SSL/TLS offloading means having a proxy server between the client and your application. The proxy server is responsible for handling all the encryption/decryption and forwards everything on to your applications.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/encryption_offloading.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminates the need to handle any encryption/decryption within your application and so allows you to focus your development time on making new features for your users.</li>
  <li>HTTPS certificates only need to be configured for the proxy and not on all the backend applications.</li>
  <li>Security patches for SSL/TLS only need to be applied to the proxy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="downside-to-handling-https-in-your-application">Downside to handling HTTPS in your application</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Slows down development</li>
  <li>Updating certificates is harder</li>
  <li>You need to run your application with root privileges</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="slows-down-development">Slows down development</h3>
<p>It can be quite a lot of effort getting everyone on your development team setup with your development certificates. You have to configure your browsers to use them, you need to add exceptions to allow self-signed certificates, and you also make things harder for yourself when you want to debug the traffic being sent to and from your application. <strong>Just run your application unencrypted during development</strong> and offload the SSL/TLS to your proxy on your production environment.</p>

<h3 id="updating-certificates-is-harder">Updating certificates is harder</h3>
<p>Imagine a security flaw is discovered in SSL/TLS and you need to upgrade. Wouldn’t it be nice to just update the proxy, instead of having to go through each of your applications and update them in turn?</p>

<h3 id="you-need-to-run-your-application-with-root-privileges">You need to run your application with root privileges</h3>
<p>For your application to be listening for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443), it would require root privileges. <a href="http://bencane.com/2012/02/20/why-you-should-avoid-running-applications-as-root/">It is not a good idea to run your application with root privileges</a> so even if your application is currently working with HTTP, using a proxy to forward the traffic to your application is good practice. There are some tools (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authbind">authbind</a>) which will allow your application to listen on ports below 1023 without needing root privileges. However, with a proxy in place, changing to use HTTPS is easy. There is no reason to make the changes in all of your applications.</p>

<p>Having something like <a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/">NGINX</a> or <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> in front of your applications offers a lot more then just the HTTPS. You also get load balancing, content cache, and monitoring. These are the added bonuses of using a proxy.</p>

<p>Added clarity to <code class="highlighter-rouge">You need to run your application with root privileges</code> section after recieving <a href="https://github.com/calum/calum.github.io/issues/1">comments</a> from github user <a href="https://github.com/KillerX">KillerX</a> who pointed out</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Binding to port 80 or 443 requires an application to start with elevated privileges but nothing prevents the application from dropping them as soon as the port is bound thus not operating as root. As well as nice tools that help you to never need root privileges in the 1st place.</p>
